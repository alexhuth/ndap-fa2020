i grew up a uh a huge fan of of the new york yankees which when i was very small involved going to games maybe once a year with my my father and my little brother watching uh reggie jackson and a little bit older watching uh dave winfield and then when i kind of came into my teens uh don mattingly who was you know my absolute favorite player and as i i went to high school in new york and it was kind of a turning point the first time that i went to a yankee game by myself and i started going to yankee games by myself and it was at one of these games in the fall of nineteen ninety one that i went up to the stadium bought a ticket to the bleachers and went and sat in the bleachers and was watching um the game and noticed for the first time something that i'd i'd been to the stadium so many times before but i'd never seen uh this kid in right field wearing a yankee uniform who was a bat boy playing catch with the right fielder and i'd never noticed the bat boy before and this kid could not play catch for his his life he was throwing the ball over jesse barfields had the right fielder and he was one hopping him and i was like ya know i i'm not a   athlete but i can play catch at least at least as well as this kid can and i don't understand why he has you know that job and and i couldn't and so i went home that night and i tore a page out of the program that listed all the different you know yankee executives and i wrote a hand written letter to everyone from steinbrenner on down to stump merrill who was the manager at that point and basically said ya know my name is matt and i'm sixteen years old and i'm a huge fan of the yankees and you know i don't know if you can apply for this bat boy position but if you can i really would like an application and i'm so excited to hear from you that if i don't hear from you soon i'm gonna follow up with with a phone call so i sent these off and about two weeks went by and after you know two weeks i hadn't heard anything and so i picked up the phone and the s s yankee switchboard number was on the same list of executives and secretary answered the phone hello new york yankees and i said hi this is matt mcgough and i sent a letter in a couple weeks ago 'bout applying for a bat boy position and nobody got back to me so she's like ok well i'll take your name down and i'll have somebody get back to you and she took took my number down and another week goes by and i don't hear anything so i pick up the phone again and i call and this woman answers the phone hello new york yankees and i say hi this is matt you know i sent some letters in about the bat boy position and i called last week and somebody was supposed to call me back but you know i thought it was kind of rude that that they hadn't and so she you know she laughed and she asked me how old are you and i said sixteen and she laughed some more and i didn't really understand what she was laughing at but you know she took down my name again she said you know um i'll make sure that somebody gets back to you so you know a few days later sure enough in the mail um a letter arrived on on yankee letterhead official letterhead and it invited me to come up to the stadium for an interview with nick priori who's the clubhouse manager so i put my jacket and and tie on i don't even think i told any of my friends about this cause it was way way too weird to explain so i went and took the four train up to the stadium and walked into the you know walked around the stadium and this is october so they weren't playing in the world series in october back in ninety one so it was very very quiet and i walked around the stadium and walked into the yankee lobby and there's this security guard there and i introduce myself and i say i'm here for the bat boy interview and he picks up the telephone and he's like you know nick some kid's here to see you and you know ok i'll and so he says you  know have a seat so i sit down in in the pinstripe lobby and i'm you know passing about ten minutes waiting for this guy nick to come up for the first job interview of my life for the first job of my life and i'm you know trying to think of the questions that he might ask me so i'm ready to uh tell him what my favorite subject is in school and tell him you know why i think the yankees need a big bat behind mattingly you know to win the pennant next year and what you know mickey mantle's batting average was in nineteen fifty six and like all these different questions so you know i'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and this guy walks in obviously nick but he doesn't introduce himself he's you know could be anywhere from forty to eighty years of age he has this greased back hair and he's has a stogy between the two teeth left in his mouth and a chew of tobacco possibly also and this wife beater t shirt and yankee shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he's shoe polish uh like black sneakers that are obviously shoe polished and he just looks at me and says are your parents gonna mind you taking the train home late at night so i say n you know i take the train to school every day i think it i think it ll be fine and he just kind of looks at me and finally i say no i don't think my parents will mind me taking the train home late at night and he says well come back opening day so that was october you know i go home i think i have the job i'm not not really sure and you know six months later opening day nineteen ninety three i show up at nine a m i put on my jacket and tie i walk back to the stadium i go back downstairs you know through these tunnels and come to this you know big steel door that says yankee clubhouse on and i walk inside and it's complete pandemonium and you know there's uh these ball players that i'd only seen before on tv are across rows and rows of stadium seats and like they're there in the flesh in front of me and don mattingly is over you know on the right and i had a poster of don mattingly above my bed you know for my whole life and he's standing right over there and jimmy key the ace of the pitching staff is over there and and all these guys and you know opening day yankee stadium is not just a sports event it's a news event beginning of spring and in new york and mayor dinkins is there with his entourage and like it's mayor dinkins and don mattingly you know it's so uh i'm walking around and kind of lost and i figure you know i better go find find nick so i walk up to nick and i say nick what do you you know what do you i'm matt we met a couple of months ago what do what do you want me to do it's my first first day of work so he says stay the f out of my way so i kind of like shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of wandering around in a daze and i feel a tap on my shoulder i turn around and it's don mattingly and he sticks his hand out and he says how's it going i'm don mattingly are you gonna be working with us this year which you know even at that moment i'd never really thought about the experience in those terms and he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been as cool as that like he could have said you know are you the who are you or are you the new bat boy are you gonna be working for us this year but he said you know i'm don mattingly are you gonna be working with us this year so i said i know who you are mister mattingly i'm matt i'm the new bat boy and he's like great to meet you matt i have a very big very big job to ask of you i've just unpacked all my bats fro from spring training and i don't know if it was the altitude of the flight up from florida or the humidity down there or what but the game starts in about two hours and i need you to find me a bat stretcher so i say ok so i go i go and find nick and i go you know nick is is busy probably half a dozen ball players are like bothering him for double a batteries or you know my hat size my hat's too small or this or that and i go up and i'm like nick i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and he lets loose with a stream of expletives that fell on i swear completely virgin ears like i never never heard that type of language in the movies before or anywhere let alone directed at me so i kind of like rock back on my heels and go and find somebody i can trust like n nick's assistant rob and i ask him you know i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and nick told me to go f myself and i don't i don't know what to do so he was like chill out you know i saw danny tartabull using one in his locker so danny tartabull's the you know power hitting right fielder i go to his locker and i'm he's getting dressed in his uniform and i stand off on the side and he says you know how's it going and i'm like fine i'm matt i'm the new bat boy and i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and i heard you were just using one so he's like well i was using one but i left it in the manager's office you should probably go check in there so i say thanks and he says see you around and i go into the manager's office and walk in and buck showalter the manager is having a press conference with probably like eight or ten reporters and i stand off on the side and i'm kind of you know the conversation comes to a standstill basically because there's a sixteen year old kid there in his easter blazer and jacket in standing in the manager's office of the yankee stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day looking very lost and very anxious and showalter turns to me and he's like can i help you and i say i i'm matt i'm the new bat boy s really sorry to interrupt but i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and danny tartabull says that he left it in here so showalter looks down like beneath his desk and you know he's like well you know i do you need a right handed one or a left handed one so this is the first moment all day that i actually you know this is the first question that i had that i could answer with complete confidence cause you couldn't have grown up in new york at that time you know without knowing that mattingly was the best left handed hitter in baseball so i say i need a left handed bat stretcher so he's like well i think we maybe have a right handed one around here but probably not a left handed one and like you should try down at the red sox clubhouse and see if they have one so i say o ok thanks i'll you know i'm sorry to interrupt i go off at at this point i'm like sprinting down the hallways like the tunnels beneath the stands the first base stands of the stadium and i run into the red sox clubhouse and find their equipment manager and give him like the whole story i'm matt i'm the new bat boy for the yankees and danny tartabull left his right handed bat stretcher in uh in buck showalter's office and i need a left handed one and like the game's about to start and he's like calm down like you know we don't have one but we need one like here's twenty bucks go up to the sporting good store on one sixty first street and river avenue and buy two like buy a left handed one for mattingly and a right handed one for us and then bring me back the change so he gives me the twenty i put it in my pocket i run upstairs you know at this point it's like an hour before opening day the fans are coming down like fifty thousand fans are coming down from you know the subway in the opposite direction that i'm walking i'm the only person in the world who knows that you know if i don't come through on this mission mattingly is gonna go up there against roger clemens and the red sox on opening day yankee stadium with a toothpick in his hand basically so i'm like fighting against the crowd and feeling so much weight on my shoulders and i make my way you know and i'm about to cross the threshold of stan's sporting goods when it dawns on me like i've played a lot of baseball in my life and i've you know been a big fan for a while and like i don't even know what a bat stretcher looks like uh and it it this moment that i'm like walking into the store it dawns on me for the first first time like is uh is this a joke like could this possibly could this possibly be a joke and if it you know but i had so much fear because like if it is a joke and i like go back and i tell don mattingly you know i'm too smart to fall for your you know ya your b s bat stretcher story and i'm wrong i'm gonna be back in the bleachers like before my first game you know and and lose my dream job so you know i take three laps around the stadium kind of convincing myself like it's gotta be a joke like it's gotta be it's gotta be a joke and i you know i walk back back in i go down the stairs i walk into the clubhouse mattingly winks at me from across the clubhouse a couple of other ballplayers laugh mattingly goes three for five that day yankees win it was my first day in pinstripes and uh you know i didn't learn until later on that i was the first kid in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection without you know somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody or or whatever which was you know a lesson a lesson in itself and you know as intensely naive my pursuit of that job was you know i was probably as naively intense in chasing the bat stretcher but you know the lesson in the story is you know when there is with a great deal of persistence and a little bit of common sense even if the thing you're chasing may not exist you can sometimes will it into being thank you
